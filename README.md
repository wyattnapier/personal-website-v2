# Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Wyatt Napier and this is my personal website.
I built this to demonstrate some of the aspects of my life that aren't captured by my resume.
Feel free to checck it out at [wyattnapier.com](https://wyattnapier.com/) and let me know if you have any suggestions!

### TODOs

This is a little list of future goals for this website just so I remember:

- Add routes
- Add projects page
- Add support for highlighting important days like birthdays and anniversaries!
- Add some new photos and captions every now and agian
- Add recipes page perhaps structured like how albums are with cover aart and simple name and expected cooktime
