# Welcome to my personal website!
My name is Wyatt Napier and this is my personal website. 
I built this to demonstrate some of the aspects of my life that aren't captured by my resume. 
Feel free to check it out at [wyattnapier.com](https://wyattnapier.com/) and let me know if you have any suggestions!
